<h2>Outline/Existential Tree</h2>
<p>The subsumption hierarchy is not the only "axis" on which an ontology relies.
 Many other axis (such as partOf) can be useful for navigation.

<p>The <b>Outline View</b> follows existential (and appropriate cardinality) restrictions
 to build up a view of the current class by its structure.

<p>The <b>Existential Tree view</b> is a simplified version that shows the tree along a specified property.
