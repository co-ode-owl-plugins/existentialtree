The subsumption hierarchy is not the only "axis" on which an ontology relies. Many other axis (such as partOf) can be useful for navigation.

The Outline View follows existential (and appropriate cardinality) restrictions to build up a view of the current class by its structure.

The Existential Tree view is a simplified version that shows the tree along a specified property.
